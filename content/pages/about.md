With over 20 years of experience in software engineering and management, I am a passionate and skilled leader who strives to deliver cutting-edge and user-centric solutions. My mission is to bridge the gap between technical and non-technical stakeholders, ensuring seamless communication and collaboration. My field of expertise is developing full stack software applications and managing end-to-end software development lifecycles, from concept to delivery. I currently work as a Software Development Manager at a leading Canadian tech company which is a global leader in IoT and connected transportation.

In my current role, I lead a cross-functional team of software engineers, designers, and testers in a fast-paced and agile environment. I am responsible for overseeing the design, development, testing, and deployment of several innovative features and services that help differentiate our product from the competition. Some of the skills I use daily include Project Management, Technical Leadership, Management by Measurement, Strategic Management and System Design. 

I have MBA with specialization in Strategic Management and Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science and Engineering.

I like to experience new cultures during travels :airplane: :bullettrain_side:, astronomy :milky_way: :telescope:, watching sci-fi movies :movie_camera:, listening to classical music :notes: and spending time with my family. I use this website to share information about myself and share my personal opinions :clipboard: and ideas :bulb:. My goal in life is to make the world :earth_asia: a better place than how I found it :smile:.
